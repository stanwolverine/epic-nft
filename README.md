# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

Pending Tasks:
1. Set a limit on the # of minted NFTs
2. Add a button to let people see the collection!
    > Button mag  = "ðŸŒŠ View Collection on OpenSea"
    > This link you'll need to hardcode. It can't be dynamically generated unless you use the OpenSea API
